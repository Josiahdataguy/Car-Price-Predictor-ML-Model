# Car-Price-Predictor-ML-Model

In this project, I collected the data "Cardetails.CSV" which contains all needed car details and trained a model(Linear Regression) then deployed it.

## Steps I Used to develop the model.

1. Data Collection: I collected a dataset that contains details about car's price and factors that affect the price(mileage, manufacture year e.t.c)
2. Data Exploration and Preparation: In this step, I cleaned the data by dropping null values and duplicates.  I converted string values to float. I split the data set into input data and output data for training testing and validation.
3. Machine Learning Modelling: In this phase, I developed the Linear Regression Model
4. Model Evaluation: To analyze the performance of these models, I used various evaluation metrics such as accuracy & precision.
5. Deployment: I developed the web application 'app.py' using python and the Linear Regression model then I deployed it using Streamlit.
